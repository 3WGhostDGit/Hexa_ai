init next js + shadcn and prisma + supabase + firebase for auth  

Augment
I'll help you set up a Next.js project with Shadcn UI, Prisma ORM, Supabase, and Firebase for authentication. Let's start by gathering information and then create a detailed plan.

Information Gathering
Let's first check if there's any existing code in the workspace:

Terminal
$ ls -la
Now I'll create a detailed plan for setting up the project.

Detailed Plan
Initialize Next.js project
Use create-next-app to set up a new Next.js project
Configure with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
Set up Shadcn UI
Install and initialize Shadcn UI components
Configure the theme and component system
Set up Prisma
Install Prisma CLI and client
Initialize Prisma with a schema
Create basic data models
Set up Supabase
Install Supabase client
Configure Supabase connection
Set up database tables via Prisma schema
Set up Firebase Authentication
Install Firebase SDK
Configure Firebase for authentication
Create authentication utilities
Create basic project structure
Set up pages/routes
Create authentication components
Set up layout and basic UI
Let's start implementing this plan:

Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project
Terminal
$ npx create-next-app@latest .
11:17 AM
use pnpm 

Augment
I'll use pnpm to set up the project. Let's start with initializing the Next.js project using pnpm.

Detailed Plan (Updated)
Initialize Next.js project with pnpm
Use pnpm create next-app to set up a new Next.js project
Configure with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
Set up Shadcn UI
Install and initialize Shadcn UI components using pnpm
Configure the theme and component system
Set up Prisma
Install Prisma CLI and client with pnpm
Initialize Prisma with a schema
Create basic data models
Set up Supabase
Install Supabase client with pnpm
Configure Supabase connection
Set up database tables via Prisma schema
Set up Firebase Authentication
Install Firebase SDK with pnpm
Configure Firebase for authentication
Create authentication utilities
Let's start implementing this plan:

Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project with pnpm
Terminal
$ pnpm create next-app .
I see there's a test.txt file that's causing a conflict. Let's create a new directory for our project:

Terminal
$ mkdir hexa-app && cd hexa-app
Now let's initialize the Next.js project in the new directory:

Terminal
$ cd hexa-app && pnpm create next-app .
I see we're now in the hexa-app directory. Let's continue with initializing the Next.js project:

Terminal
$ pnpm create next-app .
Let me check if the Next.js project was created successfully:

Terminal
$ ls -la
Let's check the app directory structure:

Terminal
$ ls -la app
Now let's check the package.json to see what dependencies were installed:

Read file
package.json
Error
Ran into Cannot read file: package.json while trying to read package.json
Let's try again with the full path:

Read file
package.json
hexa-app
Now let's continue with our plan and set up Shadcn UI:

Step 2: Set up Shadcn UI
Terminal
$ pnpm add -D @shadcn/ui
Now let's initialize Shadcn UI:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
Let's check if the Shadcn UI configuration was created:

Terminal
$ ls -la
Let's check the updated package.json:

Read file
package.json
hexa-app
Let's try running the Shadcn UI init command again with the verbose flag to see what's happening:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init --verbose
I see that the shadcn-ui package is deprecated. Let's use the new shadcn package:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
Great! Shadcn UI has been successfully initialized. Now let's set up Prisma:

Step 3: Set up Prisma
Terminal
$ pnpm add prisma -D
Now let's add the Prisma Client:

Terminal
$ pnpm add @prisma/client
Now let's initialize Prisma:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx prisma init
Now let's set up a basic Prisma schema. First, let's check the generated schema:

Read file
schema.prisma
hexa-app/prisma
Let's check the .env file:

Read file
.env
hexa-app
Now let's update the Prisma schema with some basic models. We'll create a User model and a few other models for our application:

Edited file
schema.prisma
hexa-app/prisma
Now let's update the .env file with a placeholder for Supabase connection:

Edited file
.env
hexa-app
Now let's set up Supabase:

Step 4: Set up Supabase
Terminal
$ pnpm add @supabase/supabase-js
Now let's create a Supabase client utility:

Terminal
$ mkdir -p lib/supabase
Now let's create the Supabase client file:

Created file
client.ts
hexa-app/lib/supabase
Now let's set up Firebase for authentication:

Step 5: Set up Firebase Authentication
Terminal
$ pnpm add firebase
Let's create a Firebase configuration file:

Terminal
$ mkdir -p lib/firebase
Now let's create the Firebase client file:

Created file
client.ts
hexa-app/lib/firebase
Now let's create an authentication context for our application:

Created file
auth-context.tsx
hexa-app/lib/firebase
Now let's create a Prisma client utility:

Created file
client.ts
hexa-app/lib/prisma
Now let's update the layout.tsx file to include our AuthProvider:

Read file
layout.tsx
hexa-app/app
Edited file
layout.tsx
hexa-app/app
Now let's create a basic authentication page:

Terminal
$ mkdir -p app/(auth)
Let's create a login page:

Created file
page.tsx
hexa-app/app/(auth)/login
Let's create a registration page:

Created file
page.tsx
hexa-app/app/(auth)/register
Now let's create a dashboard page:

Terminal
$ mkdir -p app/(dashboard)
Error
Cannot launch another waiting process while another waiting process is running. The id of the existing waiting process is 20.
Please wait until this process is complete (you can use a tool for this purpose), or launch the new process as a background process with `wait=false`.
Let's check the status of the running process:

Terminal
Listed Processes
Let's kill the running process and try again:

Terminal
Killed Process
Error
Terminal 19 not found
Let's try creating the dashboard directory again:

Terminal
$ mkdir -p app/(dashboard)
Let's create a dashboard page:

Created file
page.tsx
hexa-app/app/(dashboard)/dashboard
Now let's update the home page to redirect to the dashboard or login page:

Read file
page.tsx
hexa-app/app
Edited file
page.tsx
hexa-app/app
Now let's install the Shadcn UI components we're using:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input label
Error
Cannot launch another waiting process while another waiting process is running. The id of the existing waiting process is 22.
Please wait until this process is complete (you can use a tool for this purpose), or launch the new process as a background process with `wait=false`.
Let's check the status of the running processes:

Terminal
Listed Processes
Let's kill the running process:

Terminal
Killed Process
Error
Terminal 21 not found
Let's try installing the Shadcn UI components:

Terminal
$ pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input label
Let's check the status of the installation:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's try to run the development server to see if our application works:

Terminal
$ pnpm dev
Let's check the status of the development server:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's try running the development server from the hexa-app directory:

Terminal
$ cd hexa-app && pnpm dev
Let's check the status of the development server:

Terminal
Read from Process

where i need to get firebase config 

Augment

You need to get your Firebase configuration details to fill in the Firebase Configuration section of your .env file. Here's how to obtain those values:

Getting Firebase Configuration
Go to the Firebase Console:
Visit https://console.firebase.google.com/
Sign in with your Google account
Create a new project or select an existing one:
Click "Add project" if you need to create a new one
Follow the setup steps (name your project, accept terms, etc.)
Add a Web App to your Firebase project:
Once in your project dashboard, click on the web icon (</>) to add a web app
Give your app a nickname (e.g., "Hexa App")
You can check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" if you plan to deploy with Firebase
Click "Register app"
Get your configuration details:
After registering, Firebase will show you the configuration code that looks like this:
Copy these values to your .env file:
Copy each value from the Firebase configuration to the corresponding field in your .env file:
You can always access these configuration details later by:

Going to your Firebase project
Clicking on the gear icon (⚙️) next to "Project Overview"
Selecting "Project settings"
Scrolling down to the "Your apps" section
Finding your web app and clicking on the config icon
Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the Firebase setup or your project?

11:45 AM
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAmo5VL8cHCafL8t4875hp8XJnyb_kuDAI",
  authDomain: "hexa-ai-783a2.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "hexa-ai-783a2",
  storageBucket: "hexa-ai-783a2.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "719017271824",
  appId: "1:719017271824:web:c609b25774fcb93e1fa095",
  measurementId: "G-KW3BE65XYQ"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

Augment
I see you have your Firebase configuration code. Let's update your .env file with these values. I'll help you add these Firebase configuration details to your project:

Read file
.env
hexa-app
Now let's update the Firebase configuration in your .env file with the values you provided:

Edited file
.env
hexa-app
Now let's also update our Firebase client file to include the analytics functionality you have in your configuration:

Read file
client.ts
hexa-app/lib/firebase
Edited file
client.ts
hexa-app/lib/firebase
Now your Firebase configuration is properly set up in your project. The Firebase configuration values from your code snippet have been added to the .env file, and I've updated the Firebase client file to include analytics support.

Here's what's been done:

Added your Firebase configuration values to the .env file:
API Key
Auth Domain
Project ID
Storage Bucket
Messaging Sender ID
App ID
Measurement ID (for analytics)
Updated the Firebase client file to:
Import the analytics functionality
Add the measurement ID to the config
Initialize analytics in a browser-safe way (only on the client side)
Export the analytics object for use in your application
Your Next.js application is now properly configured to use Firebase Authentication and Analytics. The Firebase client is set up to be used throughout your application for authentication and analytics purposes.

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
        

# Connect to Supabase via connection pooling
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.lhmpiraajuygjzjjxtwm:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection to the database. Used for migrations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.lhmpiraajuygjzjjxtwm:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"


Augment
I'll help you update your Prisma schema and environment variables with the Supabase connection details you've provided. Let's make these changes:

First, let's update the Prisma schema:
Read file
schema.prisma
hexa-app/prisma
Now, let's update the Prisma schema with the connection pooling configuration:
Edited file
+3 -2
schema.prisma
hexa-app/prisma
Now, let's update the .env file with the Supabase connection details:
Read file
.env
hexa-app
Edited file
+6 -2
.env
hexa-app
Now that we've updated the Prisma schema and environment variables with the Supabase connection details, let's generate the Prisma client to make sure everything is working correctly:

Terminal
$ cd hexa-app && pnpm dlx prisma generate
Let's try again with a different approach:

Terminal
$ cd hexa-app && pnpm exec prisma generate
Let's try to approve the build scripts first:

Terminal
$ cd hexa-app && pnpm approve-builds
